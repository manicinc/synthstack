# SynthStack Licensing FAQ (Community Edition)

SynthStack uses a dual-license model:

- **Community Edition (this repo)**: non-commercial (see `../LICENSE`)
- **SynthStack Pro**: commercial use (see `../COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md` and https://synthstack.app/pricing)

## What “Non-Commercial” Means

Community Edition is intended for:
- Learning and evaluation
- Personal projects
- Internal prototypes that are not monetized

Community Edition is **not** allowed for:
- Selling subscriptions or charging end-users
- Client work where you’re paid to deliver the software
- Building a competing boilerplate/starter kit

If you need commercial usage rights, use SynthStack Pro:

## Can I Modify the Code?

Yes. You can fork and modify the code, but you must comply with the Community License restrictions.

## Can I Deploy It?

Yes, for non-commercial use cases.

If you plan to run a revenue-generating production app, you need Pro.

## Where Are The Full Terms?
