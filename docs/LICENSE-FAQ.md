# SynthStack Licensing FAQ

## General Questions

### What license does SynthStack use?

SynthStack uses a **dual-license model**:
- **Community Edition**: Modified MIT License (non-commercial, no competing boilerplates)
- **Commercial Edition**: Proprietary Commercial License (commercial use, unlimited SaaS products)

### Can I use SynthStack for free?

Yes! The Community Edition is free for:
- Learning and educational purposes
- Personal side projects
- Portfolio demos
- Internal tools (non-commercial)

For commercial production use, you need a Commercial License.

## Commercial Use

### What counts as "commercial use"?

Commercial use means:
- Selling subscriptions to end-users
- Charging customers for access
- Revenue-generating SaaS products
- Client work where you're paid for the software

### Can I build unlimited SaaS products?

**Yes!** With a Commercial License, you can build:
- Unlimited SaaS applications
- Apps in any industry (CRM, invoicing, AI, etc.)
- Revenue-generating products
- White-labeled client projects

There are NO per-project fees or revenue sharing.

### Can I charge users for my SaaS?

**Yes!** You can:
- Offer paid subscriptions
- Charge one-time fees
- Implement usage-based pricing
- Generate unlimited revenue

Your pricing model is up to you.

## What's NOT Allowed

### Can I create another SaaS boilerplate?

**No.** You cannot use SynthStack to build:
- Competing SaaS boilerplates or starter kits
- Template marketplaces
- "Launch in 7 days" type products
- Code generators where templates are the primary value

This restriction protects our business model while giving you maximum freedom to build actual SaaS products.

### Can I resell the SynthStack code?

**No.** You cannot:
- Redistribute the source code
- Publish to GitHub/NPM/marketplaces
- Resell license access
- Sub-license to third parties

### Can I share the code with clients?

**It depends:**
- ✅ Deploy applications for clients (they use YOUR product)
- ✅ Host and maintain the software for clients
- ❌ Give clients the SynthStack source code
- ❌ Transfer your license to clients

If your client needs their own license, they should purchase one.

## White-Labeling & Customization

### Can I remove all SynthStack branding?

**Yes!** Commercial License allows:
- Complete rebranding (logo, name, colors)
- Removing all attribution and "Powered by SynthStack"
- Custom domain and hosting
- Your brand identity throughout

### Can I modify the code?

**Yes!** You can:
- Add new features
- Remove unwanted components
- Integrate third-party services
- Customize UI/UX
- Change tech stack components

There are no modification restrictions.

---

## Subscription System

### The boilerplate includes subscription billing - can I use it?

**Yes!** You can:
- Offer subscriptions to YOUR end-users
- Use the included Stripe integration
- Implement the credit system
- Charge customers for access

**This is allowed because:**
- Your product is a SaaS application (not a competing boilerplate)
- End-users are paying for YOUR product's functionality
- You're not reselling SynthStack itself

---

## Team & Multi-Developer Use

### Can multiple developers use my license?

**It depends on the tier:**
- **Individual License** ($297): 1 developer
- **Team (5) License** ($997): 5 developers
- **Team (20) License** ($2,997): 20 developers

Teams can collaborate on projects using the appropriate license.

### What if I hire contractors?

Contractors working on your SynthStack-based projects count toward your license seat limit. Purchase a Team License if you need multiple developer seats.

---

## Updates & Support

### Do I get lifetime updates?

**Yes!** All Commercial Licenses include:
- Bug fixes forever
- Security patches forever
- Major version upgrades (first 12 months included)

### What support is included?

- **Individual**: Community support (Discord, GitHub)
- **Pro**: Email support (48-hour response)
- **Team**: Priority support (24-hour response) + Slack

---

## Enforcement & Violations

### What happens if I violate the license?

If you create a competing boilerplate or violate terms:
1. We'll contact you to resolve the issue
2. You'll have 30 days to cure the violation
3. If unresolved, license terminates
4. You must cease use and delete source code
5. Existing deployed apps may continue running

We're reasonable! Accidental violations can usually be resolved by changing how you use SynthStack.

### How do you detect violations?

We **don't actively monitor** licensees. Most violations are reported by community members or discovered during support requests.

Our approach is **trust-based** with clear terms - just like ShipFast and SupaStarter.
